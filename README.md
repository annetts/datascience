# Data Science
Udacity Data Science Nanodegree project repository.

Code for the first blog post in Medium:
https://medium.com/@annett.saarik/most-popular-languages-and-frameworks-used-by-developers-2a70cf7189

## Libraries
Python, jupyter notebook, numpy, pandas, matplotlib

## Motivation for the project
Real motivation was the curiosity to find out what languages and frameworks do developer use at the moment and to find out what developers are looking forward to use in the future. This is useful to consider a putting in the time to learn a new language and what should it be.

## Files in the repository 
There is a .ipynb file that contains the Python code that is used to find out and display in a table the results of top 10 in every category: "Most used language", "Most want to use language", "Most used framework" and "Most want to use framework".

## A summary of the results
New popular language to look out for are Rust and Go. Flask is the new lightweight framework to maybe learn more about. 


## Project Questions
### Business Understanding - Brief description
Trying to understand the usage and trends in language and dataframe usage with developers in the StackOverFlow 2020 Survey.
#### Question 1
What are most popular languages and frameworks that developers have used?
#### Question 2
What are most popular languages and frameworks that developers want to use in the future?
#### Question 3
Is there any new languages or frameworks that developers want to use? Are there any supprising trends?

## Data Understanding
#### Access and Explore
Data was downloaded from StackOverflow website.
#### Prepare Data
Reading in the dataset to Jupyter Notebook in the Pandas framework. Left original column names.
#### Wrangle and Clean
Did not clean or remove Nan values from dataset. 
#### Modeling
Only selected columns that I needed to answear my questions. 

#### Question 1 - What are most popular languages and frameworks that developers have used?
##### Analyse, Visualise, Explain the visualisation

#### Question 2 - What are most popular languages and frameworks that developers want to use in the future?
##### Analyse, Visualise, Explain the visualisation

#### Question 3 - What are the trends and suprising new languages gainig popularity?
##### Analyse, Visualise, Explain the visualisation
