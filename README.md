# Data Science
Udacity Data Science Nanodegree project repository.

Code for the first blog post in Medium:
https://medium.com/@annett.saarik/most-popular-languages-and-frameworks-used-by-developers-2a70cf7189

## Libraries

Python, jupyter notebook, numpy, pandas, matplotlib

## Motivation for the project

Real motivation was the curiosity to find out what languages and frameworks do developer use at the moment and to find out what developers are looking forward to use in the future. This is useful to consider a putting in the time to learn a new language and what should it be.

## Files in the repository 

There is a .ipynb file that contains the Python code that is used to find out and display in a table the results of top 10 in every category: "Most used language", "Most want to use language", "Most used framework" and "Most want to use framework".

## A summary of the results

New popular language to look out for are Rust and Go. Flask is the new lightweight framework to maybe learn more about. 

## Necessary acknowledgements 

Big thanks to Udacity reviews for the comments to make this project better.
